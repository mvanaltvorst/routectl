to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.8.0] - 2026-06-07

### Added

- **Config-overridable identity defaults (codex + anthropic egresses).** Compiled identity-header defaults fire on zero-config; operator `header_extras` overrides any key.
  - Merge order in `build_headers`: auth headers (never overridden) -> compiled defaults -> `header_extras` -> per-request UUIDs (always win).
  - `chatgpt-oauth`: emits `originator`, `x-openai-internal-codex-residency`, `version` from pinned constants.
  - `oauth-bearer` anthropic-api: emits `x-stainless-*`, `x-app`, `anthropic-dangerous-direct-browser-access` (dynamic OS/arch); `user_agent` defaults to `claude-cli/<version>` when unset.
  - Superseded `OpenAiResponsesConfig` fields (`session_id`, `installation_id`, `originator`) are now auto-generated or carried via `header_extras`.

- **codex CLI fingerprint mirroring (chatgpt.com surface).** The `openai-responses` codex egress and its OAuth refresh client present every fingerprint-relevant header as codex CLI does, fixing sessions invalidated within minutes and step-upped to phone verification.
  - New `routectl-core::codex_fingerprint` module: single source of truth for the codex `User-Agent`, the `originator`/residency defaults, and the process-global `x-codex-window-id`.
  - Per-request headers stamped: `version`, `session-id`, `x-codex-installation-id`, `x-codex-window-id`, `thread-id`, `x-client-request-id`.
  - `session_id` is per-credential: persisted on the `credentials.json` token record, minted on `routectl login codex`, lazy-backfilled into older records, preserved across refresh.
  - Static identity headers ride the config-overridable defaults above (overridable via `header_extras`); `thread-id` / `x-client-request-id` are a fresh UUIDv4 per turn.
  - Pinned codex version and the fingerprint-header lockstep contract are documented in `docs/PROVIDER-QUIRKS.md`.

- **`bedrock-mantle` bearer-token auth on the `openai-responses` provider.** New `auth_kind = "bedrock-mantle"` replaces the prior `NotImplemented` stub.
  - Unlocks AWS Bedrock GPT-5.5 (and future Mantle-hosted Responses models) with no new provider kind.
  - Wire shape is verbatim OpenAI Responses, so request assembly, the SSE state machine, decoding, and the URL builder are reused unchanged.
  - Only delta is the bearer source (typically `env://AWS_BEARER_TOKEN_BEDROCK`); the `/openai/v1` prefix lives in `base_url`.

- **Hot-reload of `credentials.json` and `config.toml`.** A single watcher on the parent directories (`IN_CLOSE_WRITE`/`IN_MOVED_TO`, 250ms debounce) plus a `SIGHUP` escape hatch feed one reload coordinator.
  - Parse-validate-or-keep-old: an invalid write logs a WARN with the parse error and keeps the current config; only successful parses swap in.
  - Hot-reloadable: `[providers]`, `[models]`, `[aliases]`, `[retry]`, `[bedrock]`, and `credentials.json`.
  - Restart-required (emits a diff-WARN on change): `server.host`, `server.port`, `server.auth`, `server.max_body_bytes`, `[log]`.
  - Circuit-breaker counters, RPM buckets, the OAuth token cache, and per-provider refresh mutexes survive the reload.

- **`[server] max_body_bytes`, per-model `max_output_tokens`, and raised internal caps.**
  - `max_body_bytes`: request-body cap, default 32 MiB (was a hardcoded 4 MiB); returns 413 above the cap.
  - `max_output_tokens`: caps the injected `max_tokens` on the Anthropic-shape egresses (`anthropic-api`, `bedrock-invoke`) when the caller omits it. Resolution: `request.max_tokens` -> `[models.X] max_output_tokens` -> `64000` baseline. Other egresses forward omission cleanly.
  - Caps raised for parallel-tool-fanout / long conversations: anthropic ingress tool-call index 64 -> 4096, openai-responses output-block count 512 -> 4096, anthropic-api thinking-cache entries 1000 -> 10000.

- **Per-provider `max_thinking_entry_bytes` knob** (`[providers.X]` of `kind = "anthropic-api"`). Tunes the per-entry byte cap on the `context_management` thinking-cache.
  - Range 1 KiB to 4 MiB, default 1 MiB; zero falls back to the default with a WARN; over-ceiling clamps with a WARN.

- **Startup WARN when `context_management = true` without `history_reasoning = "preserve"`.** The two are complementary on non-Anthropic anthropic-api endpoints (DeepSeek `/anthropic`, vLLM, LM Studio); without `preserve`, the next turn 400s on missing thinking. The WARN fires once at startup instead of per dispatch.

- **`max_completion_tokens` -> `max_tokens` translation (OpenAI Chat ingress).** o-series / gpt-5+ clients send `max_completion_tokens`, which the canonical request lacked, so it was silently dropped. It is now renamed before deserialization (`max_tokens` wins if both are present).

- **`role: "developer"` support (OpenAI Chat ingress).** The system-voice successor `developer` role is rewritten to `system` before deserialization, so it flows through the system-message lift instead of failing with a 400.

### Changed

- **`Error::Internal` added to the error taxonomy** for unexpected runtime failures (serialization bugs, socket / serve-loop IO, impossible states).
  - Six sites that misused `Error::Config` for non-config failures are reclassified.
  - The HTTP mapping returns a generic `internal error` to clients while logging detail at ERROR; `Error::Config` is now documented as configuration-validation-only.

- **Default retry jitter is now 50ms** (`RetryPolicy::default().jitter_ms`, was 0), giving retry spread out of the box.

- **`context_management` thinking-cache per-entry cap raised 256 KB -> 1 MiB.** The 256 KB cap rejected writes on full-budget Opus 4.6/4.7/4.8 turns (~328 KB at 65k thinking tokens); 1 MiB gives ~3x headroom. Tune down via `max_thinking_entry_bytes`.

- **`context_management` thinking-cache TTL is now sliding.** Each hit refreshes `expires_at` to `ttl-from-now` (matching Anthropic / DeepSeek prompt-cache semantics); idle entries still die after the 60-minute window.

- **Internal:** structural decomposition and shared-helper extraction across the bedrock and anthropic-api modules (shared eventstream framing driver, hoisted HTTP/header helpers, request-builder split, consolidated identity module, unified provider seam naming, test-builder dedup into `routectl-core`) -- no behavior change.

### Fixed

- **Bedrock Converse `stop_sequence` round-trip.** The request always declares `["/stop_sequence"]` in `additionalModelResponseFieldPaths`, and routectl reads the matched literal back (gated on `stop_reason == "stop_sequence"`) on the non-streaming and streaming paths. A schema-drift DEBUG fires when the stop reason indicates a match but the field is absent.

- **anthropic-api effort caps no longer bypassed via `provider_extras`.** `merge_provider_extras` overwrote the clamped `output_config.effort` with the raw caller value, so a client could ship an unclamped effort (e.g. `max`) despite a declared `effort_levels`. The post-merge seam now re-clamps `output_config.effort` (sibling sub-keys untouched). Affects `anthropic-api` and `bedrock-invoke`.

- **anthropic-api: probe `thinking` 400, `signature: null`, and openai-compat envelope leak.**
  - Claude Code probes (`max_tokens` 48-128) 400'd because legacy thinking derived a budget with no floor; `thinking` is now dropped with a WARN when `max_tokens` cannot fit a >=1024 budget plus content, instead of mutating the caller's `max_tokens`.
  - A reasoning detail with no signature rendered `signature: null` (rejected on a mid-conversation provider switch); the field is now omitted when absent.
  - openai-compat envelope fields (`object`, `system_fingerprint`, `cost`, top-level `role`) and usage sub-bags are filtered at the openai-compat parse seam so they stop leaking onto Anthropic-shape responses.

- **`count_tokens` body allowlist drops `metadata`.** `/v1/messages/count_tokens` 400'd on `metadata` ("Extra inputs are not permitted"); it is removed from the allowlist (`output_config` is documented as accepted but token-count-irrelevant).

- **anthropic-api: opaque-block stop sentinel and dropped-reasoning WARN.** A degraded opaque (unknown-type) block that overflowed the capture cap after its `content_block_start` left an unclosed block; `content_block_stop` is now emitted unconditionally. A structured WARN fires when `emit_reasoning_blocks` drops non-`anthropic-claude-v1` `reasoning_details`.

- **anthropic-api `allowed_betas` enforced on the `anthropic-beta` header.** The allowlist applied only to the (stripped-before-send) body field, so the header the upstream inspects carried the unfiltered list. Header and body now share one predicate.

- **OpenAI ingress: tool_use double-render, system `cache_control` loss, stop-sequence strip.**
  - tool_use parts are stripped at the OpenAI render seam when `tool_calls` is present, so Chat clients stop receiving duplicate tool_use blocks (Anthropic paths untouched).
  - Parts-form system messages now emit `SystemContent::Blocks` when a block carries `cache_control`/citations, instead of flattening to plain text.
  - The internal `matched_stop_sequence` field is stripped from every choice on both render paths.

- **anthropic ingress: streaming usage and finalization.** The closing `message_delta` now defaults a missing `prompt_tokens` to 0, attaches usage only when populated, early-returns from the error-eos path once finished, drops a JSON-null `output_format`, and builds the non-streaming usage object incrementally (no more null cache-usage fields).

- **openai-compat: mid-stream errors and hardened lifts.** A mid-200 error envelope now reports as an upstream error (not a chunk-deserialize error); a JSON-null usage sub-bag no longer blocks the usage lift; a `tool_result` without `tool_use_id` hard-fails (matching anthropic-api); the reasoning-strip WARN catches the `Thinking` part shape; and streamed `reasoning_details` increment `detail_index` per block.

- **openai-responses: signature passthrough, cancel semantics, reasoning logging.** The Anthropic-shape signature is forwarded into `encrypted_content` only when the source format matches; `response.cancelled` and a payload-less `response.completed` surface as upstream errors; dropped non-`openai-responses-v1` reasoning is summarized in one DEBUG.

- **bedrock-converse: forward text documents and envelope `reasoning_details`.** Text-source documents are normalized to base64 instead of dropped; unmapped/missing media types log on drop; the egress emits `ReasoningContent` for `anthropic-claude-v1` details (skipping unsigned blocks Bedrock rejects) and no longer emits an orphan `cachePoint` for an empty system block.

- **bedrock: reserve `x-amz-*` headers and sign the User-Agent.** An operator `header_extras` `x-amz-*` entry could desync the SigV4 signature, so the prefix is now reserved. The UA is inserted pre-sign (SigV4-signed and trace-visible); a chunk frame missing its `bytes` field is skipped with a WARN instead of killing the stream.

- **router: half-open breaker probe slot released on all exits.** Several dispatch exits (probe fast-fail, auth-refresh failure/success, retry-without-fallback, non-fallbackable client errors) returned without recording an outcome, leaking the single probe slot and pinning the breaker open until restart. A no-debit slot release now runs on every such exit, and the gate runs inside the retry loop in `stream`/`count_tokens` to match `complete()`.

- **router: 429 non-retryable when excluded from fallback; operator beta floor and `header_extras` preserved.** The 429 retry arm is now gated on fallbackability like the 5xx arm; a model-level `anthropic-beta` rides a separate operator-floor field (re-added after the `allowed_betas` filter instead of being dropped); and `apply_layered_overlays` preserves the composed `header_extras` map across the `routectl_internal` rebuild.

- **factory: dedup bedrock credential probe on the failure path; WARN on the bedrock-mantle region pin.** Sibling Bedrock models no longer re-run the SSO probe after one fails (the failure path now consults `provider_failed`); the `us-east-1` bedrock-mantle endpoint fallback now WARNs so other-region operators are not silently misdirected.

- **auth: close the OAuth reload/refresh race; bound the login read.** A generation counter lets a stale refresh detect a concurrent `reload_from_disk` and discard its result; the unbounded login-line read is replaced with a bounded `read_line` loop.

- **file-watch: suppress the misleading Remove WARN on atomic rewrites.** Atomic-rewrite editors issue Remove + Create in one batch; the handler now matches the sibling Create/Modify by basename and emits a DEBUG breadcrumb instead of "watched file was removed". Lone Remove events keep the WARN. (#38)

- **build: the `openai-responses` feature now declares `dep:chrono`** (previously it built only when a sibling feature pulled `chrono` in).

### Documentation

- **Reference-drift sweep** across `CONFIGURATION.md`, `CODEMAP.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `LOGGING.md`, `PROVIDER-QUIRKS.md`, and `WIRE-GOTCHAS.md`: the bedrock framing driver, the two-tier retry resolution and per-error-class caps, the bedrock `api_shape` selector, the 256-char WARN body-excerpt cap, 6 reasoning dialects, the 300s OAuth refresh lead, per-provider runtime gates, config-show secret redaction, the non-loopback-bind auth requirement, and the per-direction header-trace policy. Each verified against the cited code.

- **New `[server]` knob docs** in `CONFIGURATION.md`: `max_body_bytes` and `allow_disable_fallbacks` (plus its `x-routectl-disable-fallbacks` header), and the per-model `max_output_tokens` resolution chain.

- **Replay harness recast** around a local-only fixture corpus: `REPLAY-FIXTURES.md` is now a format reference, the "Adding a replay fixture" flow collapses to 5 steps, and the capture script stamps the workspace version into fixture metadata.

### Security

- **Eventstream payload logging gated behind TRACE on both Bedrock decoders.** The Converse decode-error path and `contentBlockStart` handler logged decoded, upstream-controlled output (possible prompt-derived secrets/PII) at WARN/DEBUG; both now log only the 12-byte prelude (or top-level key list) and gate the full payload behind TRACE, matching the Invoke decoder.

- **Bearer JWT redacted from the outgoing-headers TRACE.** `routectl-core::log_safe` emitted `Authorization: Bearer <jwt>` verbatim, exposing live access tokens. The fix lives at the lowest trace layer (all four providers covered); `Authorization`, `x-api-key`, and `proxy-authorization` values are masked while names are preserved.

- **Cloudflare cookie jar on the chatgpt.com client.** The `openai-responses` provider attaches a persistent jar (default `~/.config/routectl/cookies/chatgpt.json`, mode 0600, `ROUTECTL_COOKIE_FILE`-overridable), allowlist-filtered to Cloudflare service-cookie names so account/session cookies never hit disk.

- **OAuth refresh tracing with `sha256[0:8]` hashes.** Pre-POST, success, and failure events emit grant type, status, and hashed-token correlation; token values are never logged, failure events omit body excerpts (some endpoints echo `refresh_token`), and a canary test pins that no echoed token leaks.

- **Upstream error bodies sanitized against log-line forgery.** Upstream-controlled 4xx/5xx bodies and the forward-compat SSE `content_block.type` were logged without control-char filtering (CR/LF/ANSI could forge log lines); openai-compat, openai-responses, bedrock, the shared DEBUG full-body helper, and the SSE block-type capture now filter them.

- **Secret-ref values redacted from error messages.** `SecretRef::parse` and the listener-token resolver embedded the raw reference in error strings; they now report only a validated scheme prefix (or, for listener tokens, the entry position).

- **Operator `header_extras` cannot override codex fingerprint headers** on the ChatGPT-OAuth path, keeping the impersonation contract intact.

- **Per-entry size bound on the anthropic-api thinking cache.** Oversized writes are rejected with a WARN (the next turn recovers as it would on a TTL eviction), preventing unbounded LRU growth. Truncation was rejected -- it would corrupt the opaque continuity signature on Anthropic thinking blocks.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-05-30

The v0.7 release: routectl-managed OAuth login (Anthropic + Codex)
with runtime refresh and one-shot 401 recovery, claude-code as a
first-class gateway client, forward-compat for unknown Anthropic SSE
block types, server-side emulation of the context-management beta
for non-Anthropic anthropic-api endpoints, and a BREAKING refactor
moving model reasoning capabilities from per-provider floors to
declarative per-model fields.

**Responsible use.** Anthropic publishes a gateway pattern at
<https://code.claude.com/docs/en/llm-gateway> for first-party
deployments. routectl's `oauth://anthropic` ref and gateway support
are for personal-use proxying with the operator's own subscription
token; per the Anthropic Agent SDK overview, claude.ai OAuth tokens
may not be embedded in third-party products. routectl does not
support or condone gateway usage beyond what the upstream provider
permits and does not vouch for whether a particular credential is
permitted to be used a particular way -- read the upstream
provider's terms before pointing routectl at production traffic.
See [`docs/CONFIGURATION.md`](docs/CONFIGURATION.md) "claude-code as
a gateway client" for the operator setup, and the README
"Responsible use" section.

### Added

- **routectl-managed OAuth client** (Anthropic + Codex). `routectl
  login <provider>` runs PKCE through a loopback callback, persists
  tokens atomically to `~/.config/routectl/credentials.json` (chmod
  0600, tempfile + fsync + rename). New `oauth://<provider>`
  SecretRef resolves at request time through a `CompositeStore`.
  `--print-url` headless flow on Anthropic; rejected for Codex
  (no headless paste-back; SSH operators port-forward 1455).
  `routectl whoami` reports stored token expiry. `SecretToken`
  newtype zeroizes on drop with a redacted `Debug`.

- **OAuth runtime refresh + 401 recovery.** Lazy refresh at egress:
  `oauth://` resolution checks near-expiry (300s lead -- matches the
  codex CLI 5-minute refresh window), acquires a
  per-provider mutex, double-checks under the lock so concurrent
  gets collapse to one refresh per window, persists atomically.
  New `Provider::on_auth_failure` hook lets a 401 force-rotate the
  token and retry the same provider once. New `routectl logout
  <provider>` and `routectl refresh <provider>` ops subcommands.
  Migration: replace `env://ROUTECTL_ANTHROPIC` with
  `oauth://anthropic` after running `routectl login anthropic`
  once.

- **claude-code as a first-class gateway client.** Implements the
  Anthropic-published gateway contract for Anthropic Messages, so
  claude-code with `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL=http://routectl` works
  without silent capability downgrades. New per-provider
  `forward_client_headers: Vec<String>` opt-in for `x-claude-code-*`
  attribution headers (defaults to drop). New `POST
  /v1/messages/count_tokens` proxy with an explicit 8-field body
  allowlist (first-target-only dispatch -- tokenizer correctness;
  no fallback walk). `GET /v1/models` skips alias keys with `*` so
  the picker does not show unroutable globs. New per-dialect
  `ErrorEnvelopeShape::{Anthropic, OpenAi}` so each ingress emits
  its native error shape. New `Error::NotImplemented(provider, op)`
  maps to 501 (covers `count_tokens` on Bedrock today).

- **Server-side emulation of `context-management-2025-06-27`.**
  New per-provider `context_management: bool` on `[providers.X]`
  of kind `anthropic-api` (default false). When true, routectl
  caches thinking blocks observed in upstream responses (bounded
  LRU at 1000 entries + 60-minute TTL, keyed by `(provider_id,
  tool_use_id)`), re-injects them on next-turn requests per the
  `clear_thinking_20251015` keep policy, and strips the beta
  header + body field on egress. Unblocks Anthropic-API-shaped
  upstreams (e.g. DeepSeek `/anthropic`) that demand thinking
  echoback but do not implement the beta natively. Composes with
  `history_reasoning`: strip on canonical messages first, inject
  on wire last.

- **Forward-compat for unknown Anthropic SSE block types.**
  `Other(Value)` catchalls on three strict-tagged enums
  (`SseEvent`, `SseContentBlockStart`, `SseDelta`) plus
  `OpenBlockKind::Unknown` in the SSE state machine, so an
  unrecognized `content_block.type` no longer crashes the stream
  and walks the fallback chain. A `#[serde(skip)] opaque_events`
  carrier on `ChatChunk` captures the upstream event bytes
  (value-preserving / semantically lossless for valid JSON); the
  matching Anthropic ingress re-emits them so strict clients (citation
  links, search-status UI) see the full upstream wire. Bounded
  caps (256 KB / 10000 deltas per block) downgrade overflow
  silently with a WARN. Bedrock-Invoke inherits the fix free;
  Bedrock-Converse streaming forward-compat is a separate task.

- **Per-provider `unsupported_features` filter + cross-alias
  resolution.** Operator-declared list on `ProviderRuntimePolicy`;
  the router strips date suffixes from request `tools` to derive
  feature keys and removes providers whose declared list intersects
  request features BEFORE dispatch. Eliminates wasted Bedrock
  round-trips for `web_search_*`-bearing requests; when the filter
  eliminates every provider the request fails 501 instead of
  cascading 400s. Cross-alias resolution lets a chain entry
  reference another alias key (not just a model nickname); cycle
  detection runs at startup with a runtime depth cap of 8.

- **`probe_max_tokens` fast-fail on 429 / 529.** New `[retry]
  probe_max_tokens` knob (default 1, 0 disables). claude-code's
  `max_tokens=1` availability probes used to walk the full fallback
  chain on rate-limit; a request with `max_tokens <=
  probe_max_tokens` now skips retry AND fallback on 429/529 and
  returns the status immediately. Other errors keep the normal
  retry / fallback path; real requests above the threshold are
  unaffected.

- **`[log]` config block** for runtime knob fallbacks.
  `trace_headers`, `trace_body_bytes`, `redact_prompts` gain a
  config-side default. Resolution per knob: env wins when set,
  then `[log]` if set, then the hardcoded default. `ROUTECTL_LOG`
  stays env-only because it must reach the tracing subscriber
  before config loads.

- **Opt-in 4-direction HTTP header tracing**
  (`ROUTECTL_TRACE_HEADERS=1`). Emit headers on all four hops --
  ingress in/out, egress in/out -- routed through the existing
  `log_safe` redaction so bearer JWTs and API keys are masked.
  `scripts/capture_fixtures.sh` consumes the new format.
  `docs/DEVELOPMENT.md` documents the toggle.

- **Stream-error terminator emission.** When an egress stream
  errored mid-stream, the ingress used to drop the SSE channel
  without a terminator; multi-turn SDKs interpret the silent
  disconnect as truncation and retry up to 5 times. Both ingress
  dialects now emit a dialect-appropriate terminal event before
  closing (Anthropic `event: error`; OpenAI `data: {"error":{...}}`
  then `data: [DONE]`). Errors forwarded to clients are sanitized
  via `sanitize_stream_error_for_client`: only `upstream stream
  error (HTTP <status>)` reaches the wire so per-tenant existence
  hints stay out of the client-visible payload.

### Changed

- **anthropic-api egress: STRIP unsigned `thinking` blocks instead
  of REJECTing.** The 400-on-missing-signature check broke
  cross-provider fallback (a turn handled by deepseek with its own
  signature format, then a turn that walks to Anthropic) and SDKs
  that drop `signature` on serialization.
  `validate_replay_invariants` -> `normalize_replay_invariants`,
  returning `Cow<'a, [Message]>` so unmodified requests pay zero
  clone cost. `history_reasoning = "preserve"` opts a model out of
  the strip (required for upstreams like DeepSeek `/anthropic`
  that demand unsigned thinking echoback). One structured WARN
  fires per request when stripping occurs; block content is never
  logged.

- **Effort clamping is now uniform across all egresses** when
  `effort_levels` is non-empty. Anthropic-API and Bedrock now
  consult the model's declared `effort_levels` and clamp the
  caller's effort to the nearest supported value (rounding toward
  the most capable when above the declared maximum, the least
  capable when below the minimum). Empty list keeps the
  pass-through default for OpenRouter-style providers that perform
  their own effort translation. Shared `clamp_effort_to_supported`
  helper in a new `routectl-providers::effort` module.

### Fixed

- **`thinking` stripped when `tool_choice` forces tool use.**
  Anthropic Messages and Bedrock Converse reject `thinking` paired
  with `tool_choice = {type:"any"|"tool"}`. Strip `thinking` (not
  `tool_choice`) so caller intent to force a named tool is
  preserved; `auto`, `none`, absent are unaffected.

- **Stale `extra_headers` doc references renamed to
  `header_extras`.** Field was renamed in v0.6.0; a few snippets
  and the example config still referenced the legacy spelling.

- **`cache_control` system-block drop demoted from WARN to
  DEBUG.** OpenAI Responses has no equivalent surface; the strip
  is correct, the WARN level just trained operators to ignore
  real WARNs.

- **CI clippy gate tightened to `--all-features`.** The clippy
  steps in `ci.yml` and the local pre-commit hook were labeled
  "all features" but omitted the flag, so feature-gated test files
  never type-checked under the strict gate; tightening exposed
  pre-existing breakages in `live_matrix.rs`.

- **Doc-vs-code currency sweep.** `[providers.X]` / `[models.X]`
  field placements, `adaptive_thinking` ->
  `supports_adaptive_thinking` rename references, the
  `stream_first_byte_timeout_ms` resolution table (now three
  tiers: model > provider > global), DeepSeek `context_management`
  example base URL with `/anthropic` suffix, the
  `header_extras["anthropic-beta"]` mechanism, the corrected
  `effort_levels` clamping description, the `anthropic.rs` ->
  `anthropic/{mod,parse,render,stream}` directory split, the
  corrected `MAX_LOG_BODY_EXCERPT` size in `LOGGING.md`. Cross-doc
  links converted from bare backtick text to Markdown link syntax.

### Removed (BREAKING)

- **`thinking` and `effort` on `[models.X]`** -- replaced by three
  declarative capability fields: `supports_adaptive_thinking`
  (bool, selects the adaptive vs legacy thinking wire shape),
  `effort_levels` (array, default `["low","medium","high"]`;
  drives clamping; empty = pass-through), `max_thinking_budget`
  (u32 tokens, default 0 = no cap). Migration: declare
  capabilities explicitly on each `[models.X]` block per the
  vendor docs. The `EffortLevel` enum and the
  `merge_reasoning_defaults_into` helper are deleted.

- **`adaptive_thinking` on `[providers.X]` of kind
  `anthropic-api`** -- the egress now reads
  `supports_adaptive_thinking` from `RoutectlInternal` per request.
  `Bedrock-Invoke` and `Bedrock-Converse` keep the static
  `adaptive_thinking` field on `BedrockConfig` because Bedrock
  model IDs do not carry the same Anthropic-vs-Bedrock split.

- **`fallback_on_status` on `[retry]`** -- replaced by the
  two-field `retry_allowlist` / `retry_denylist` schema (mutually
  exclusive at config-load). With both unset (the new default)
  every 4xx / 5xx falls back, which is strictly more permissive
  than the previous 15-code default and still covers Cloudflare
  extended 5xx codes (520-527, 530); operators wanting the narrow
  behavior set `retry_allowlist` explicitly. No back-compat shim:
  configs using `fallback_on_status` need a one-line rename.

### Security

- **OAuth callback rate limiting** (two-window guard).
  Per-source-port (30 hits / 10s) AND listener-wide (60 hits /
  10s) on the loopback callback, so a co-resident process spraying
  ephemeral ports cannot drown a legitimate browser callback during
  the 120s login window. Memory bounded (256-entry LRU + capped
  VecDeque). State-valid browser callbacks bypass the tracker
  entirely.

- **OAuth refresh hygiene.** The OAuth HTTP client disables
  redirect-following so a 307/308 from the IdP cannot replay the
  refresh-token POST to a different host. Refresh-flow errors and
  JSON parse errors omit upstream body excerpts (some IdPs reflect
  request fields in error envelopes; refresh bodies carry the
  long-lived refresh token).

- **Anthropic upstream-error body excerpts sanitized in WARN
  logs.** The 4xx / 5xx WARN logs in `complete()` and `stream()`
  used to emit `body_excerpt = %msg` directly from the upstream
  message; an upstream returning CRLF in `error.message` could
  forge log lines on text-format tracing subscribers.

- **`capture_fixtures.sh --out` rejects symlink components.** A
  dangling symlink under `captured/` could let fixture writes
  (which carry raw upstream headers) land outside the gitignored
  tree. A per-component `[ -L ]` walk now runs before physical
  resolution. `--allow-unsafe-out` still bypasses the check for
  legitimate symlink-traversal use cases.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-05-20

The big v0.6 release: layered provider + model config, dispatch
hygiene fixes, openai-compat normalization, and a wave of dogfood
fixes from daily live use.

### Added

- **Layered provider + model config**. `[providers.X]` carries
  transport-wide knobs (auth, base URL, runtime gates) and
  `[models.X]` carries per-model behavior (reasoning, dialect,
  quirks). Two fields live on BOTH layers and merge at dispatch
  time -- `header_extras` and `payload_extras` -- with model winning
  on key collision and `anthropic-beta` comma-unioning across all
  sources. The router's `apply_layered_overlays` helper runs the
  merge before calling `provider.complete()` / `provider.stream()`
  so the `Provider` trait surface stays stable across all four
  concrete providers (openai-compat, anthropic-api, bedrock,
  openai-responses).

- **`[models.X]` first-class TOML table**. Required: `provider`
  (key in `[providers.X]`), `upstream` (wire model id). Optional:
  `thinking` (bool or `"adaptive"`), `effort` (enum), `reasoning_dialect`,
  `history_reasoning`, `additional_request_fields`, `anthropic_beta`,
  `stream_first_byte_timeout_ms`, `header_extras`, `payload_extras`,
  `selectable`.

- **Suffix-glob alias keys** in the unified `[aliases]` table:
  `"claude-opus-*" = "heavy"` matches any wire model starting with
  `claude-opus-`. Lookup precedence: exact match > longest matching
  prefix > `default`. Alias values are `String | Vec<String>` --
  single string is a one-entry chain, list is a fallback chain.

- **`Router::new` precomputes** a `BTreeMap<String, Arc<ResolvedModel>>`
  from `[models]`, so dispatch is one O(1) lookup per hop. Unknown
  nicknames in alias chains fail at startup, not at first request.

- **Tracing dispatch events** carry `model = <nickname>` alongside
  `provider = <provider_name>` for per-model triage.

- **`anthropic-beta` HTTP header lifted into canonical
  `req.anthropic_beta`**. The Anthropic TypeScript SDK translates
  the `betas: [...]` SDK option into an `anthropic-beta: a,b,c` HTTP
  header (not a body field); claude-code uses this surface for
  first-party betas (context-management, prompt-cache-1h,
  adaptive-thinking, ...). routectl now lifts the header so the
  egress emits it in the upstream body (Anthropic accepts either
  surface).

- **`POST /v1/messages` openai-responses provider** (default-on
  `openai-responses` Cargo feature). ChatGPT Codex endpoint via
  `chatgpt-oauth` bearer JWT. Stream-only (`complete()` forces
  `stream:true` and drains SSE to `response.completed`). Flat
  Responses-shape tools and `tool_choice`. `instructions` field
  always serialized (the server 400s if absent).

- **Operator-owned Bedrock allowlists** -- `[bedrock] allowed_betas`
  and `[bedrock] allowed_body_fields` in TOML. Filters the body's
  `anthropic_beta` array (Invoke and Converse) and any forward-compat
  body fields the Anthropic ingress sweeps in (`mcp_servers`,
  `diagnostics`, `context_hint`, `speed`, ...). routectl ships no
  built-in default; AWS schema drift is operator-tracked. Empty list
  (or omitted `[bedrock]` section) is pass-through for discovery --
  bring up routectl, observe sent flags via
  `ROUTECTL_LOG=routectl_providers::bedrock=trace`, populate the
  lists. `examples/bedrock.toml` ships the empirical 2026-05-12
  baseline (16 betas + 16 body fields).

- **`history_reasoning` per-provider knob** on `[providers.X]` of
  type `openai-compat`. Three values: `auto` (default; defer to the
  dialect's strip-vs-preserve default), `strip` (required for
  DeepSeek v3 and vLLM <= 0.6), `preserve` (required for DeepSeek
  v4+ and vLLM 0.7+ hosts that 400 on missing echo-back).
  Per-dialect preserve impls: DeepSeek and vLLM render
  `reasoning_content` scalars; OpenRouter renders typed
  `reasoning_details[]`; OpenAI and Passthrough are no-ops.

- **Per-provider and per-model timeout overrides**:
  `request_timeout_ms` and `stream_first_byte_timeout_ms`. Resolution
  priority: per-model > per-provider > global `[retry]`. Eliminates
  alias-level repetition (e.g. NIM cold-start, Opus 4.7
  high-effort).

- **CF extended 5xx range in default `fallback_on_status`**:
  `[408, 429, 500, 502, 503, 504, 520-527, 530]`. Cloudflare-fronted
  upstreams (opencode.ai, openrouter.ai) surface upstream-origin
  failures via 520-527; without these in the default list, a single
  520 would kill a request even when a sibling provider in the chain
  could have served it.

- **`ROUTECTL_TRACE_BODY_BYTES` env var** to override the 16 KB
  TRACE body cap at process start. Set to 1 MB (`1048576`) for
  live-traffic fixture capture; real claude-code requests routinely
  exceed 16 KB. Resolved cap is announced once at server boot.

- **`scripts/capture_fixtures.sh`** -- operator script that drains
  the TRACE log into per-request fixture directories under
  `crates/routectl-cli/tests/fixtures/captured/` (gitignored). Atomic
  writes via `.tmp.<id>.XXXXXX` rename pattern.

- **`docs/PROVIDER-QUIRKS.md`** -- operator-facing config guide.
  Per-model rows for Anthropic Opus 4.7+ (adaptive thinking),
  DeepSeek v4 (echo-back), vLLM 0.7+, NIM (reasoning_effort gate +
  cold-start cushion), Anthropic / Bedrock / OpenRouter / OpenAI.
  Cross-cutting timing notes, multi-host fallback chain examples,
  troubleshooting matrix.

- **`SECURITY.md`** -- vulnerability disclosure policy.

### Fixed

- **Per-model circuit breaker isolation**. Two `[models.X]` rows
  pointing at the same `[providers.X]` now have independent breaker
  counters and RPM buckets. State is keyed by `[models.X]` nickname,
  not by provider name -- a single flaky model no longer trips the
  breaker for every healthy sibling on the same transport.

- **Bedrock SSO probe deduplication** across models on one
  `[providers.X]`. The factory now caches resolved AWS credentials
  per provider name; building 5 Bedrock models on one provider hits
  the credential chain once instead of 5x.

- **Alias chain validation at startup**. `serve` and `routectl test`
  reject `[aliases]` chains pointing at unknown OR
  `selectable = false` `[models.X]` nicknames before the server
  binds, instead of silently returning `UnknownAlias` at first
  request time. Validator accumulates every offending alias/nickname
  pair into one consolidated error.

- **Per-model `header_extras` reaches the wire**. The merged value
  (provider + model + ingress) lands on `req.anthropic_beta` and the
  Anthropic egress emits one comma-unioned `anthropic-beta` HTTP
  header.

- **Anthropic legacy thinking budget clamp**. Drop legacy
  `thinking: Enabled` when `req.max_tokens <= 1024` (Anthropic
  requires `max > budget`, floor `budget >= 1024`); enforce both the
  1024 floor and the `max - 1` ceiling on every Enabled emission
  path. Caught live on probe-sized requests (e.g. title-generation,
  topic-summary, "continue?" prompts with `max_tokens=64`) when the
  operator's per-model config carried `thinking = true effort =
  high`. Bedrock Invoke + Converse share the helper transitively.

- **openai-compat: strip vendor envelope + lift usage sub-bags**.
  Anthropic-shape ingress + openai-compat upstream was bleeding
  envelope fields (`object`, `system_fingerprint`, `cost`) and four
  DeepSeek/OpenAI usage sub-bags (`prompt_cache_hit_tokens`,
  `prompt_cache_miss_tokens`, `prompt_tokens_details`,
  `completion_tokens_details`) back to the Anthropic-shape response.
  Now lifted to canonical `Usage.reasoning_tokens` and
  `Usage.cache_read_input_tokens` and stripped from the extras
  catchall. Mirrored on the SSE path before serde (`UsageDelta` has
  no extras flatten).

- **`tool_choice` shape mismatch: OpenAI bare-string -> Anthropic
  tagged-enum**. Anthropic's Messages API and Bedrock-Invoke reject
  `tool_choice: "auto"` with a 400. The Anthropic-API egress now
  translates `"auto" | "none" | "required"` and the OpenAI
  `{"type":"function","function":{"name":"X"}}` object map to
  Anthropic-shape `{"type":...}`. Anthropic-shape inputs pass
  through unchanged.

- **Top-level `system` leaks onto openai-compat wire**. The OpenAI
  ingress lifts wire `role: "system"` into canonical `req.system`
  (Anthropic-shape top-level field). The openai-compat egress now
  performs the inverse lower: prepends a synthetic
  `role: "system"` message and strips the top-level `system` key.
  Strict hosts (NVIDIA NIM) used to 400 with
  `Validation: Unsupported parameter(s): system`.

- **OpenAI ingress: `reasoning_content` keys coalesced before
  schema deserialization**. DeepSeek-shape `reasoning_content` was
  arriving unmerged on `messages[].reasoning_content`, missing the
  canonical `reasoning` lift on multi-turn echo-back. Added
  pre-deserialization coalescer mirroring the response-side
  `merge_reasoning_keys`.

- **`prompt_tokens` translation: cache_creation/cache_read summed
  into Anthropic streaming usage**. The Anthropic SSE response now
  captures `message_start` input usage, sums `input_tokens +
  cache_creation_input_tokens + cache_read_input_tokens` into the
  closing `message_delta` `UsageDelta`, and exposes per-TTL cache
  breakdown via field-level merge.

- **Stop-sequence end-to-end**. Preserve the matched stop sequence
  through canonical so the Anthropic ingress can emit
  `stop_reason: "stop_sequence"` + `stop_sequence: "<value>"` instead
  of collapsing to `end_turn`. Previously broke claude-code
  structured-output flows (stop_sequence fences the output) by
  flagging `is_error: true` on the result envelope. Bedrock Converse
  is a known follow-up -- AWS surfaces the matched sequence via
  `additionalModelResponseFields` only when the request opts in.

- **Router log clarity: chain-exhausted vs fallback hop**. Both
  `complete()` and `stream()` previously WARNed "fallback to next" on
  every fallbackable terminal error including the LAST chain entry.
  Now emits "chain exhausted; no fallback target available; request
  will fail" when no next target exists.

- **WARN at egress when canonical reasoning is silently stripped**.
  Operator visibility for the `history_reasoning = "auto"` + strip
  dialect case where the request actually carried reasoning.

- **Alias glob double-parse**. `Router::new` parsed each `*`-bearing
  alias key twice; pattern is now reused via let-binding.

- **`routectl test` help text and module docstring** referenced the
  removed `provider:model` direct-target form. Now references the
  alias key / model nickname inputs the v0.6.0 router accepts.

### Security

- **Log redaction at TRACE level**. `ROUTECTL_LOG_REDACT_PROMPTS=1`
  walks every traced body and replaces known prompt-bearing fields
  (text blocks, system, instructions, tool_use input,
  function_call arguments, refusal blocks, image source data,
  image_url data URIs, Bedrock Converse `toolUse.input`) with
  `<redacted len=N>` placeholders while preserving structural
  fields (model, tools, sampling params, finish_reason, usage).
  Read once on first traced body; one-shot startup log line
  reports the resolved value.

- **gitleaks workflow + `.gitleaks.toml`** -- secret scan on every
  PR + push + weekly full-history sweep. Inherits the default rule
  set; allowlists Cargo.lock, target/, and the captured/ fixture
  directory.

- **CI hygiene**: pinned every third-party action to a commit SHA
  with a version comment (floating tags can be retroactively moved
  by an attacker), added `permissions: contents: read` at the
  workflow level.

### Removed (BREAKING)

- `enabled` on `[models.X]` -- renamed to `selectable` to free the
  TOML key for the flattened `ReasoningDefaults::enabled` (reasoning
  on/off). Operators wanting per-model reasoning-off semantics now
  write `enabled = false`; `selectable = false` is the routing-
  disable knob.
- `[aliases.X.retry]` per-alias retry overrides -- removed when
  `[aliases]` collapsed into a flat wire-string -> nickname-or-chain
  map. Use the global `[retry]` table; per-error-class caps
  (`retry_on_429`, `retry_on_5xx`, `retry_on_network`) cover the
  knobs operators previously set per alias.
- `type` field on `[providers.X]` -- renamed to `kind` to disambiguate
  from the `type` Rust keyword.
- `model_id` on `[providers.bedrock-X]` -- moves to
  `[models.X].upstream`. Bedrock providers are no longer 1:1 with a
  model.
- `thinking`, `enabled`, `adaptive_thinking` on `[providers.X]` --
  move to `[models.X]`. Per-provider was the wrong granularity; two
  models on one provider can now carry different reasoning floors.
- `additional_model_request_fields` on `[providers.bedrock-X]` --
  renamed to `additional_request_fields` and moved to `[models.X]`.
- `default_extras` on `[providers.X]` -- moves to `[models.X]`.
- `[ingress.X.aliases]` per-ingress alias maps -- collapsed into the
  unified top-level `[aliases]` table.
- `[aliases.X] chain = [...]` sub-tables -- chains live as list
  values directly in `[aliases]`: `heavy = ["opus", "sonnet"]`.
- top-level `default_model = "..."` -- replaced by `default = "..."`
  inside `[aliases]`.
- `[bedrock] anthropic_beta` -- renamed to `[bedrock] allowed_betas`.

### Deferred

- Per-model `default_extras` and `chat_template_kwargs` deferred
  until the egress wiring lands; they will return as `[models.X]`
  fields in a future release. The provider-side fields
  (`OpenAiCompatConfig::default_extras`, `chat_template_kwargs` on
  the wire) are unaffected -- callers continue to send them
  per-request via `provider_extras`.
- Bedrock Converse stop_sequence round-trip -- AWS surfaces the
  matched sequence only when the request opts into
  `additionalModelResponseFieldPaths`. Tracked as a follow-up.
- OAuth token hot-rotation. routectl reads `ROUTECTL_ANTHROPIC` once
  at startup; a credentials.json rotation by claude-code requires a
  routectl restart. Manual snapshot + restart workflow today;
  inotify-based file-watch is staged for a future release.

### Migration

No automated migration tool; old configs hit raw serde errors at
startup. Hand-edit your TOML against the new shape -- see
`examples/config.toml` for a complete reference.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-04-XX

### Added

- **Native AWS Bedrock provider** (`type = "bedrock"`). Speaks SigV4
  directly to `bedrock-runtime.<region>.amazonaws.com`, with both
  `InvokeModel` (per-vendor body shape, default) and `Converse`
  (vendor-neutral envelope) request paths selectable via
  `api_shape = "invoke" | "converse"`. Streaming responses are
  decoded from the AWS eventstream binary frame format and re-emitted
  as routectl `ChatChunk`s; in-stream Anthropic `error` events
  (`overloaded_error`, `rate_limit_error`, etc.) surface as `Error::Upstream`
  with mapped HTTP status codes rather than silently truncating.

  Credentials resolve via four mutually exclusive `creds.kind` shapes:

  - `bearer-key` -- short-term Bedrock API key from the AWS console.
    Skips SigV4 entirely and sends `Authorization: Bearer <key>`.
  - `static` -- raw `access_key_ref` / `secret_key_ref` /
    optional `session_token_ref`, each via routectl `SecretRef` URIs.
  - `profile` -- a named profile in `~/.aws/credentials`, with SSO
    auto-refresh via `aws-config`.
  - `default-chain` -- standard AWS provider chain (env -> profile ->
    SSO -> web identity / IRSA -> EC2/ECS metadata).

  Gated behind a `bedrock` Cargo feature (default on for the binary;
  library consumers can opt out with `--no-default-features` to skip
  the `aws-config` / `aws-sigv4` / `aws-smithy-eventstream` dep tree).

  Per-provider `user_agent` override is supported and recommended for
  IAM policies that gate access via the `aws:UserAgent` condition key.
  Per-provider `anthropic_beta` flags route into the request body's
  top-level `anthropic_beta` array (Invoke) or
  `additionalModelRequestFields.anthropic_beta` (Converse).
  `additional_model_request_fields` is a free-form merge point for
  vendor-specific knobs.

  Note: For Anthropic models, both `Invoke` and `Converse` adapters
  are wired and live-tested. Converse for non-Anthropic Bedrock
  vendors (Mistral, Llama, Cohere) is staged for a later cut.

- **`POST /v1/messages` Anthropic ingress**, full tool-call
  round-trip, thinking blocks + signature preservation, typed SSE
  events (`message_start` / `content_block_*` / `message_delta` /
  `message_stop`), server-side model-id -> alias mapping
  (`[ingress.anthropic.aliases]`), and `x-routectl-alias` header
  override. Two ingress dialects (OpenAI + Anthropic) feeding one
  canonical request shape; any client speaking either wire format
  routes through any backend.

- **Canonical internal shape** absorbs Anthropic features
  losslessly: typed `ContentPart` (Text / Image / ImageUrl /
  Document / ToolUse / ToolResult / Thinking / RedactedThinking /
  Other), typed `SystemContent` (Text or Blocks), typed `ToolDef`
  (Custom / Other), top-level `cache_control` and `anthropic_beta`,
  and `Usage` cache stats. Forward-compat catchalls
  (`ContentPart::Other`, `ToolDef::Other`, `ContentBlock::Other`)
  pass unknown Anthropic block types through verbatim on the
  all-Anthropic path. `cache_control::validate` enforces the
  4-breakpoint cap and 1h-before-5m TTL ordering at ingress.

- **Listener-side auth** via static config tokens (`[server.auth]
  tokens = [...]`) accepts both `x-api-key` and `Authorization:
  Bearer`. Inbound auth is fully decoupled from upstream credentials
  (no bridging, no token storage).

- **`strict_translation`** server flag. Default `false` emits
  `tracing::warn!` on lossy seams (cache_control dropped on
  openai-compat egress, ContentPart::Other forward-compat blocks on
  egresses that don't carry them, Anthropic builtin tools dropped).
  `[server] strict_translation = true` upgrades all of these to a
  400 Bad Request, rejecting the request before it hits upstream.

- **Adaptive thinking** for Anthropic Opus 4.7+. Per-provider
  `adaptive_thinking = true` on `[providers.X]` of type
  `anthropic-api` or `bedrock` rewrites the request to the new
  `thinking: {type: "adaptive"}` + `output_config: {effort: "..."}`
  shape; budget is no longer caller-provided.

- **`extra_headers` and `user_agent` on `AnthropicApiConfig`** and
  `[providers.X]` of type `anthropic-api`. Mirrors the existing fields
  on `OpenAiCompatConfig`. Use `extra_headers` to declare any
  `anthropic-beta` flags (e.g. `context-1m-2025-08-07`,
  `prompt-caching-2024-07-31`). Use `user_agent` to override the
  outbound UA, useful for IAM-gated upstreams whose policy condition
  matches on `aws:UserAgent`.

- **Universal 4xx/5xx self-diagnosing logging**. Outgoing request
  body at `tracing::trace!`, ingress body at `tracing::trace!`,
  full upstream error body at `tracing::debug!` (cap 4 KB) on every
  4xx/5xx from any provider. Request-id correlation across the chain
  so `grep request_id=<id>` shows ingress -> egress -> upstream
  response in one shot.

### Security

- **`extra_headers` cannot override auth-bearing headers**. TOML-supplied
  `extra_headers` entries that case-insensitively match `authorization`,
  `x-api-key`, or `host` are now ignored with a `tracing::warn!`
  instead of silently overwriting the provider's auth header. This
  applies to both `anthropic-api` and `bedrock` providers.
- **`BedrockCreds` redacts secret material in `Debug` output**.
  `secret_access_key`, `session_token`, and bearer keys never appear
  in `tracing` events, panic messages, or test failures.
  `access_key_id` is shown as a 4-character prefix so operators can
  identify the active key. `BedrockConfig` is safe by transitivity.
- **Eventstream parser caps single-frame size at 8 MB**. Defends
  against a malicious or compromised upstream advertising a giant
  `total_length` to drive the inbound buffer toward OOM. Real Bedrock
  chunks are KB-scale.

### Changed

- **BREAKING (config-level)**: `auth_kind = "oauth-bearer"` no longer
  auto-injects `anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20`. Beta flags are now
  declared explicitly in `extra_headers`, decoupling auth method from
  capability gates. This unblocks API-key-auth users from setting
  `context-1m-*`, `prompt-caching-*`, and `extended-thinking-*` gates
  via the same channel.

  Migration -- if you used `auth_kind = "oauth-bearer"`, add to your
  TOML:
  ```toml
  [providers.<your-anthropic-provider>.extra_headers]
  "anthropic-beta" = "oauth-2025-04-20"
  ```
  Or, if you want the OAuth gate alongside other beta flags, comma-join:
  ```toml
  "anthropic-beta" = "oauth-2025-04-20,context-1m-2025-08-07"
  ```

### Fixed

- **Bedrock eventstream prelude drain on `Incomplete`**. Multi-chunk
  HTTP body responses (any long Opus stream) hit `InvalidUtf8String`
  mid-stream because the decoder consumed the 12-byte prelude into
  state but the caller didn't drain the cursor on `Incomplete`, so
  the next iteration reread the prelude bytes as headers. Fixed by
  draining `cursor.position()` from the buffer before breaking.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-05-06

### Added

- **Tier-1 retry/timeout policy**: per-error-class retry caps
  (`retry_on_429`, `retry_on_5xx`, `retry_on_network`), `request_timeout_ms`
  per attempt, `stream_first_byte_timeout_ms`, jitter on backoff.
- **Tier-2 routing gates**: per-provider `rpm_limit` (token-bucket), passive
  circuit breaker (`circuit_failures` + `circuit_cooldown_ms`),
  per-request `x-routectl-disable-fallbacks` header.
- **Anthropic OAuth bearer auth**: `auth_kind = "oauth-bearer"` on
  `[providers.X]` of type `anthropic-api`. Sends
  `Authorization: Bearer ...` plus `anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20`
  against the same `/v1/messages` endpoint, for callers that prefer
  that wire format over an `x-api-key` header.
- **Opinionated alias groups** in `examples/config.toml`:
  `heavy`, `med`, `cheap`, `local`, `reasoning`.
- **`ModelProfile` registry** for per-model quirks
  (`drops_sampling_params`, `requires_reasoning_effort`,
  `supports_adaptive_thinking`, `uses_chat_template_kwargs`).
- **`Dialect` trait** and `openai_compat/dialects/` per-dialect modules
  routing request/response/SSE through static dispatch.
- **`file://` SecretRef variant**: TOCTOU-safe (open-once + fd-based
  `fstat`), refuses non-regular files, refuses world/group-readable
  files, requires absolute paths.

### Changed

- **Public config types are `#[non_exhaustive]`**: `ProviderEntry`
  (enum + every variant), `ProviderRuntimePolicy`, `AliasEntry`,
  `RetryPolicy`, `RouterOptions`. External callers construct via the
  per-variant `ProviderEntry::*` factories and the chainable
  `with_runtime` / `with_extra_headers` / `with_default_extras` /
  `with_reasoning_dialect` / `with_base_url` / `with_anthropic_version`
  / `with_organization_id` / `with_auth_kind` setters. Variant-specific
  setters panic on wrong-variant misuse rather than silently dropping
  values.
- **Stream cancellation** now distinguishes half-open probe drop
  (records failure, releases the in-flight slot, re-trips circuit)
  from steady-state drop (records success, healthy provider doesn't
  flap on client cancel).
- **Half-open circuit breaker is single-probe under concurrent load**.
  An explicit `half_open_in_flight` flag gates concurrent requests so
  exactly one probe runs at a time after cooldown.
- **Per-attempt gate accounting**: RPM and breaker now debit on every
  upstream call (was per-request), so retries can't bypass the
  per-provider rate limit.
- **`ProviderEntry::redact_secrets()` and `secret_uris()`** are
  exhaustive methods on the type. The CLI delegates rather than
  matching on the variants itself, so any future variant fails to
  compile until redaction is wired up (closes the silent-secret-leak
  footgun).

### Removed

- **OS keychain support** is gone. `SecretRef` is now `env://`,
  `file://`, or `literal:` only. Rationale: routectl is not a
  credential-discovery tool and we don't want the keychain-permission
  prompt giving the wrong impression.

### Fixed

- `file://` reads no longer have a TOCTOU window between permission
  check and read; the open file descriptor is `fstat`-ed and read
  from in one go.
- `file://` URIs reject non-absolute paths instead of resolving them
  cwd-dependently.
- Stream-mid-failure now charges the circuit breaker; previously a
  provider that consistently emitted one byte and died would never be
  quarantined.
- Drop-time mutex poisoning in the stream breaker is recovered via
  `into_inner()` instead of panicking, so cancellation cleanup stays
  non-aborting.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-06

Initial release.

- Single binary, OpenAI-compatible HTTP server bound to `127.0.0.1`
  by default.
- Two provider classes: `openai-compat` (6 reasoning dialects:
  `openai`, `deepseek`, `vllm`, `raw-think-tag`, `openrouter`,
  `passthrough`) and `anthropic-api` (api-key auth; `thinking` blocks
  with `signature` preserved across multi-turn tool use).
- Reasoning normalization to OpenRouter-shape `reasoning_details[]`
  with provider-tagged `format`.
- Streaming SSE both directions, including stateful `<think>` tag
  handling for tags split across chunk boundaries.
- Fallback chain on 408/429/5xx/timeout (no fallback once first chunk
  has streamed).
- Per-provider retry with exponential backoff.
- TOML config in `~/.config/routectl/config.toml`.
